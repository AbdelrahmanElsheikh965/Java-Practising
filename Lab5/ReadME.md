# Simple Word Dictionary

## Objectives: 
• Develop an application that stores words in an array into a collection.          
• Create a map that uses the alphabet letters as keys and a collection as values (This collection should only contain words starting with the corresponding key)          
• Elements in the word map for each alphabet should be sorted          
• Provide methods to print all the letters and corresponding words          
• Provide a method to print the words of a given letter
